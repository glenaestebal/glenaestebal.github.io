<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, I’m a Computer Science graduate majoring in Network and Information Security with a passion for network and cybersecurity architecture.

I’m currently focused on upskilling through hands-on projects, certifications, and continuous learning in areas like network engineering, security operations, and GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance). My goal is to build a blended career path that bridges the gap between technical execution and strategic security leadership.

This blog serves as my personal knowledge hub — a place to document my learning journey, project progress, and insights as I grow into a cybersecurity professional. You’ll find write-ups on my coursework, personal research, and experiments that explore how secure systems are designed, implemented, and managed.

Outside of tech, I enjoy reading. I have also taken in journaling and learning how to bake.

I believe in learning with intention, documenting with clarity, and growing with purpose — one project at a time.
