### 👩🏻‍💻 Welcome to my Cybersecurity Journey

<br>This blog is where I document my path in cybersecurity — from studying core concepts and exploring new tools to reviewing lessons and preparing for certifications.

It’s my way of tracking progress, sharing insights, and building a record of everything I learn as I grow in this field. 

Along the way, I’ll also share slices of life outside tech. I love reading, I’m learning how to bake, I’m exploring journaling, and I have a deep love for music. Expect book ratings, baking experiments, travel snapshots, food pics, and a little playlist inspiration sprinkled throughout the blog — a personal touch alongside the cybersecurity content.

Currently, I'm reviewing Cybersecurity 101 with this <a href = 'https://tryhackme.com/paths'> TryHackMe </a> path. You can follow my thoughts and progress here on this blog with the tag <a href = 'https://glenaestebal.github.io/blog/tag/cybersecurity101/'> cybersecurity101 </a>! 🐳
